# DROPIFY

Hi there, this is a simple network based chat app, just take a look.

The app was created within 2 days, thats why i am really not finished with it right now.

For the future i would like to refactor my frontend , as the components and logical structure could be better.

To start the app you simply clone the repo on your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/tomedial/dropify.git

Inside of it you find another folder called dropify which is holding the server and client folder parts.

First go to to the server folder and run
"npm install"
Then you can start the app in development mode using
"npm run start:dev"

Perfect, the server is now up and running.

To start the frontend, you just go back to the client folder and run
"npm install" again

after installation just run
"npm start"


//USAGE
If you open up your localhost:3000 you see at the bottom screen you identity.
So if you open the website a second time from the same network, the App detects this, and shows you the clients on the same network.
If you click on one of those clients you can send them a message and file, so like a chat (but networkbased) :)
The client than gets an information about your message and can see it by clicking on the little Mail Icon on the button
